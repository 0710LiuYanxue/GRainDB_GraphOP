# GrainDB

# Requirements

GrainDB requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) to be installed and a `C++11` compliant compiler. GCC 4.9 and newer, Clang
3.9 and newer and VisualStudio 2017 are tested on each revision.

## Compiling

Run `make` in the root directory to compile the sources. For development, use `make debug` to build a non-optimized
debug version. You may run `make unit` and `make allunit` to verify that your version works properly after making
changes.
